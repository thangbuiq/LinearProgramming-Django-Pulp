# Linear Programming Project

This repository contains a **Linear Programming** project implemented using **PuLP** as the modeling library in **Python**. The project also utilizes **Django** as the backend framework and is hosted on **Vercel**.

## Description

It leverages the **PuLP** library in `Python` to create mathematical models and solve linear programming problems efficiently. The project is built with a **Django** backend, which provides a robust and flexible web application framework. The application allows users to define their optimization problems, input the necessary constraints and objectives, and obtain optimal solutions.

## Installation

To run the Linear Programming Project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell=
git clone https://github.com/thangbuiq/LinearProgramming-Django-Pulp.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell=
cd LinearProgramming-Django-Pulp
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```shell=
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Start the development server:
```shell=
make run
```
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the application.
